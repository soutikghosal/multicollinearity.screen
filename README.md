# multicollinearity.screen
This contains some R functions to look for multicollinearity in dataset that is constituted of both categorical and numerical variables. These functions are based on VIF, condition index, correlations (Pearson's, Cramer's V) etc. Together, these functions aid to the exploratory analysis through identifying highly correlated variables.
